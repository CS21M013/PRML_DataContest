# PRML_DataContest

The Data Contest was hosted in Kaggle environment - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/prml-data-contest-jul-2021-rb-section  
Our task was to build supervised models to predict each of the six clinical descriptors using gene expression data of patients with neurodegenerative diseases.  
The Machine Learning models used for the aforementioned purpose are as follows:  
1. Logisitic Regression  
2. Decision Tree Classifiers  
3. XGBoost Classifier  
4. AdaBoost Classifier  
5. Nearest Neighbour classifiers.  
6. Multilayer perceptrons   
7. Naive Bayes Classifier

The model was evaluated based on the Mathews Co-relation coefficient metric.
